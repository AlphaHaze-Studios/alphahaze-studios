Build a modern, elegant, single-page-style website which has on scroll page effect for an indie game studio named “AlphaHaze Studios”. 
Use only frontend (no backend). The design should be clean, smooth, and premium — similar in feel to Bhoos Games’ website (bhoos.com). 

Overall Design:
- Light theme with elegant typography and soft gradients or subtle background animations.
- Fully responsive for both desktop and mobile.
- Smooth scrolling and section fade-in/slide-in animations.
- Consistent color palette — white background, soft gray tones, and accent color (like #3C79F5 or something sleek and modern).
- Smooth hover effects on links, buttons, and cards.

### Navigation Bar:
- Centered navbar at the top of every page.
- Layout:
  - Left side: “Games” link and Store link (play store redirect)
  - Center: Studio logo (clicking it always brings you back to the homepage).
  - Right side: “About” link. and contact link
- All elements should be perfectly aligned and evenly spaced around the center.
- Navbar should be sticky on scroll.
- Smooth hover underline or color change animation for links.

### Pages / Sections:

#### 1. Homepage
- Hero section:
  - Large, minimal banner with the studio name “AlphaHaze Studios”.
  - Tagline: “Creating Fun, Simple, and Addictive Games for Everyone.”
  - “View Our Games” button that scrolls down or links to the Games section/page.
  - Add a Google Play button image linking to the studio’s Play Store account (use placeholder link for now).
- Add 2–3 more clean sections below (e.g., “Our Vision”, “Featured Games”, “Why Choose AlphaHaze?”).
- make it like page scroll, one at a time
- Include soft scroll animations (e.g., fade-in from bottom).

#### 2. Games Page
- Grid layout of game cards (like Bhoos Games’ style):
  - Each card shows a thumbnail (placeholder image) and title below it.
  - Hover effect: card slightly lifts or scales.
- Clicking a card opens the individual game page.
- Each game page includes:
  - Game title and icon.
  - Short “About this game” description.
  - “Download on Google Play” button (official Play Store badge image).
  - “How to Play” section with its screenshots.
  - “FAQs” section.

#### 3. About Page
- A short, elegant section describing the story and mission of AlphaHaze Studios.
- A “Careers” subsection describing the studio’s growth path and future opportunities.
- Include contact info and a small paragraph about studio values and passion for making games.

#### 4. Contact Page
- A simple, friendly message like:
  > “You matter to us! We’re looking forward to hearing from you.”
- Display social media icons (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Email) with hover effects.
- No form submission needed — just links to social accounts.
